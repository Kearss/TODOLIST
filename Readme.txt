Application is a todo List where you can add and remove items with a local storage.

We did all the application requirements with some of the additional one. the only ones we did not implement was the counter and drag and drop functionality. 
so overall we think did 26 points or 6 of the requirements and 3 additional ones. 
Biggest problem we had with our code is that we were unable make it so that completed items would be save to the storage and have don't a counter. 
When examining our classmates code we could have done it more simply and we thought that could have done it more simply. 
Because we were in service design sprint we were unable to add them and lost a lot of time to it.
